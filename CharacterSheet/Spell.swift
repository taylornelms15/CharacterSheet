You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.\n\tThe creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any command you have given it. You may cast this spell again to extend the duration by 24 hours, reasserting control for up to three creatures instead of animating new ones.\n\tWhen using a higher-level spell slot: using a 7th-level spell slots allows you to control four ghouls, while an 8th-level slot allows you to control five ghouls or two ghasts or wights, and a 9th-level spell slot allows you to control six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies."
