CharacterSheet TODO List:

Features (hp):
Custom feature table headers
    Class Features
    Subclass picker in table header for class features
Spell data entry


Features (lp):
Automated UI tests
    Will likely require each UI to be of a kind that I actually like


Bug Fixes:
Switching between text views/fields overall
    Especially relevant to inventory VC's, because there are so many of them
Can't "cancel" on character select deletion option, at least when there's only one deletion point left
Subclass spells not happy when subclass chosen before spell list is made; consider making blank personal spell lists at character creation for each caster class, and switching current personal spell list when we switch class?
