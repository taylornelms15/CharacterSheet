CharacterSheet TODO List:

Features (hp):
Custom feature table headers
    Class Features
    Subclass picker in table header for class features
Spell data entry


Features (lp):
Automated UI tests
    Will likely require each UI to be of a kind that I actually like


Bug Fixes:
Switching between text views/fields overall
    Especially relevant to inventory VC's, because there are so many of them
Can't "cancel" on character select deletion option, at least when there's only one deletion point left
